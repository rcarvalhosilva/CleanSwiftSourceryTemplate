# CleanSwiftSourceryTemplate
Sourcery template to generate CleanSwift boilerplate code from use case definition. CleanSwift was made to get you in the zone fast. Using this tamplate with sourcery gets you in the zone ~almost~ immediately.

## What is Sourcery?
[Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery) is a code generator for Swift language, built on top of Apple's own SourceKit. It extends the language abstractions to allow you to generate boilerplate code automatically. It was created by [Krzysztof Zab≈Çocki](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki).

## How to use it?
Just follow the steps in the Sourcery Github page to install it and the usage for your instalation.

The template makes use of a marker protocol called `Scene` and a annotation `method`. Since this template is meant to be run one time just to create the files you can remove the protocol and the annotation from your source code. *You dont have to declare the protocol!*

Given a scene use case models file like the following:

```Swift
enum MyScene {
    enum EnterEmail {
      // sourcery: method = fillEmail
      struct Request {}

      // sourcery: method = presentEmail
      struct Response {}

      // sourcery: method = displayEmail
      struct ViewModel {}
    }

    enum EnterPassword {
      // sourcery: method = fillPassword
      struct Request {}

      // sourcery: method = presentPassword
      struct Response {}

      // sourcery: method = displayPassword
      struct ViewModel {}
    }
}

extension MyScene: Scene {}
```

when you run sourcery with the this template it will create the following files:
- MySceneInteractor.swift
- MySceneBusinessLogicSpy.swift
- MySceneInteractorTests.swift

- MyScenePresenter.swift
- MyScenePresentationLogicSpy.swift
- MyScenePresenterTests.swift

- MySceneViewController.swift
- MySceneDisplayLogicSpy.swift
- MySceneViewControllerTests.swift

You can see the generated code from the example above in the [Generated](Generated) folder of this repo. The files were generated using Sourcery installed via Homebrew using the following cli command:

`sourcery --sources ./ExampleSource --templates ./Template --output ./Generated`

Don't forget to add `@testable import <YourTarget>` inside your tests and spy files
